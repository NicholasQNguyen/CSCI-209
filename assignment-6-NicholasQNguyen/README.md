# Why I chose to use a list

I chose to use a list because it had the ability to iterate, index, and sort. My program relies on for loops to have each MediaItem perform a function. So, in order to not have to rewrite all of my code, I wanted a collection that I could easily iterate over. I also needed indexing as I use it in a few loops to perform methods on only certain MediaItems such as when I check out only the firt half of the books. Finally, I wanted to be able to use a sort method and they required a sorted collection, so collections like maps and sets were out as they are unsorted.
